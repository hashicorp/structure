# Ember Modifiers
"Element modifiers" appear inside free-floating curly braces inside of an opening tag. Unlike attribute syntax, which works by substitution (and therefore affects the HTML output of your page), element modifiers work by passing the element to a function that can do anything with it.
Unlike attributes, element modifiers do not run on the server-side, because there is no general-purpose and complete way to serialize the results of an element modifier into HTML.


There are three reasons to reach for modifiers for DOM element interactions:

* A component, by itself, doesn't have direct access to DOM elements. We have to render the page, push an element back up into the component class, and only then can we safely refer to that element. This can sometimes require us to render the component's HTML twice in order for things to start working. Modifiers let us avoid this possible performance issue.
* By keeping state in the component and handling DOM method calls in a modifier, we can use autotracking and stick to 1-way data flow in the component. Further, we could change the component's own design later without having to change how we interact with the DOM element.
* The code for calling the audio element's play and pause can be reused. It isn't tied to this particular audio component. It can be tested independently, too!
