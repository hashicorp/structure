# Installing pds-ember

In an Ember project, run:

```
ember install @hashicorp/pds-ember
```

This will install NPM dependencies automatically, but additional configuration
may be required.

* [Sass](#sass)
* [Icons](#icons)


## Sass
(`ember-cli-sass` and `sass` are automatically installed as dependencies of
`@hashicorp/pds-ember`)

By default, Ember addons only expose the top-level Sass module (i.e.,
`@use "<addon>";`), but `@hashicorp/pds-ember` provides many useful Sass modules
to simplify ad hoc styling in a way that minimizes deviation from the design
system.

Some project configurations may not require it, but if you encounter
`Error: Can't find stylesheet to import.`
when you try to `@use "pds/*";` modules, you'll need to update your
`ember-cli-build.js` to add `@hashicorp/pds-ember` styles to the
`sassOptions.includePaths` configuration.


```javascript
/* ember-cli-build.js */

module.exports = function(defaults) {
  let app = new EmberAddon(defaults, {
    sassOptions: {
      includePaths: [
        // exact path may vary depending on project file structure
        'node_modules/@hashicorp/pds-ember/app/styles',
      ],
    },
  })

  return app.toTree()
}
```

## Icons

(`@hashicorp/ember-flight-icons` is automatically installed as dependency of `@hashicorp/pds-ember`)

Pds-Ember components use `<FlightIcon>` addon to show icons from the Flight icons set (for more details see: https://flight-hashicorp.vercel.app/).
