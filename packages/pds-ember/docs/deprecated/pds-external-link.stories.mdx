# ExternalLink [⚠️ deprecated ⚠️]

<img alt="Old Pds::ExternalLink vs new Hds::Link::Inline/Standalone" src={ImageFile} width="500" />

The component `Pds::ExternalLink` is now deprecated, and not available anymore. Use the equivalent `ExternalLink` component from Cloud UI or one of the two "link" components `Hds::Link::Inline` or `Hds::Link::Standalone` from the design system (check the documentation linked below to see the differences between the two alternatives, and when use one vs the other):
