# Button

`<Pds::Button />` is a wrapper around the native `<button>` element for the
purposes of applying custom UI logic for single-line button content.

## Usage

```hbs
<Pds::Button
  @compact={{boolean [false]}}
  @hideText={{boolean [false]}}
  @iconEnd={{string ['']}}
  @iconStart={{string ['']}}
  @type={{string ['button']}}
  @variant={{string ['']}}
>
  <!-- button content -->
</Pds::Button>
```
<ArgsTable of="PdsButton" />


## Styling
```scss
@use "pds/components/button";
```
**NOTE:** Styles are designed to be applied to semantic button elements
(i.e., `<button>` or button-like `<input>` elements) and may not fully apply
to other elements (i.e., elements that do not match `:disabled`).

### CSS Custom Properties

* `--pds-button-backgroundColor`
* `--pds-button-borderColor`
* `--pds-button-borderRadius`
* `--pds-button-boxShadow`
* `--pds-button-color`


## Markup
The `<Pds::Button>` Ember component handles generation of semantic HTML markup.


## Accessibility

### Text-Only
Assitive technologies will use the inner text of the button as the button label.

* **No additional markup required.**
    * This is the simplest button you can define.

```html
<Pds::Button>
  Press Me
</Pds::Button>
```

### Icon-Only
Because icons are non-textual by nature, you have to add some additional
attributes and/or markup to define an accessible label.

There are two known techniques for handling icon-only button markup.


#### Option 1: `[aria-label]`
* **Add an `[aria-label]` attribute to the button.**
    * This will override any resolved labels that are derived from button contents.
```html
<Pds::Button
  aria-label="cook bacon"
  @iconStart="frying-pan"
/>
```


#### Option 2: Visually Hidden Text Content
This technique is also known as "screen reader only" elements in many popular
web development libraries.  It takes advantage of the default label text
resolution demonstrated in the [Text-Only](#text-only) section above, but it
applies CSS styling to hide the text from sighted users without removing it
from the DOM.

* Set `@hideText={{true}}`
  * Text content of this element will be visually hidden so that it may be used
    as the accessible button label.

```html
<Pds::Button
  @hideText={{true}}
  @iconStart="bacon"
>
  Eat Bacon
</Pds::Button>
```

### Text and Icon

Text and Icons in the same button are pretty straightforward in regards to
defining the button label.  However, it proves difficult to apply various
CSS layout techniques if your text is left as a plain HTML text node.

The `<Pds::Button>` component handles this automatically. Any content defined
in the block template will be wrapped in a `<span>`, when rendered.

```html
<!-- Icon before Text -->
<Pds::Button
  @iconStart="chevron-left"
>
  Go Back
</Pds::Button>

<!-- Icon after Text -->
<Pds::Button
  @iconEnd="chevron-right"
>
  Continue
</Pds::Button>

<!-- Icons around Text -->
<Pds::Button
  @iconStart="caret-left"
  @iconEnd="caret-right"
>
  Stay Put
</Pds::Button>
```
