The `<Pds::Banner>` is intended to be used to present in-context
banner notifications that flow with the rest of DOM content.

## Usage

**NOTE:** Contextual components **MUST** be used to correctly layout content.

```handlebars
<Pds::Banner as |B|>
  <B.Header>...</B.Header>
  <B.Body>...</B.Body>
  <B.Footer>...</B.Footer>
</Pds::Banner>
```
<ArgsTable of="PdsBanner" />


## Styling
```scss
@use "pds/components/banner";
```

Included styles handle the layout of contextual subcomponents as well as the
visual appearance of the banner and defined text content.

Visual styling of elements contained _within_ each subcomponent is left up to
the consumer to conform to their individual use cases.


## Markup
The `<Pds::Banner>` and its subcomponents handle generation of semantic markup.


## Accessibility
