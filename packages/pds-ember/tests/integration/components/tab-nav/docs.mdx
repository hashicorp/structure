## Usage

```handlebars
<Pds::TabNav>
  <LinkTo>Link 1</LinkTo>
  <LinkTo>Link 2</LinkTo>
  ...
  <LinkTo>Link N</LinkTo>
</Pds::TabNav>
```
<ArgsTable of="PdsTabNav" />


## Styling
```scss
@use "pds/components/tab-nav";
```


## Markup
The `<Pds::TabNav>` component handles generation of a semantic `<nav>` element.

* `<LinkTo>` is recommended for generating tab links, because of it's built-in
  "current route" behavior, but links may be generated however you see fit.
    * If you decide to roll your own logic, make sure to apply the `.active`
      class to the "current" link.


## Accessibility
**NOTE:** The `<Pds::TabNav>` component generates a `<nav>` element with a
`[role="tablist"]`, as described by the WAI-ARIA authoring practices for a
["Tabs" widget](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#tabpanel).
However, it currently _does not_ implement any of the additional behavior,
described in the same document.
