# CTA Link
The CTA Link component extends the Ember `<LinkTo>` component by applying
additional CSS class names in order to give the resulting hyperlink a
button-like appearance.

## Usage
`<Pds::CtaLink />` has the same functionality as the
[`<LinkTo />`](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.components/methods/LinkTo?anchor=LinkTo)
Ember component.

**NOTE:** `<Pds::CtaLink>` renders a hyperlink (`<a href="...">`), which cannot
be semantically `:disabled`.

<ArgsTable of="PdsCtaLink" />


## Styling
```scss
@use "pds/components/cta-link";
```


## Markup
The `<Pds::CtaLink>` component handles generation of semantic HTML markup.


## Accessibility
* `@disabled` applies a CSS class for styling and prevents route transitions,
  but does not prevent focus.
  - **Use sparingly!**
  - Keyboard focus can be removed by setting `[tabindex="-1"]` on the component
    (removing it from the focus order).
  - Mouse focus can only be prevented by blocking the 'click' event via a
    JavaScript event listener.
