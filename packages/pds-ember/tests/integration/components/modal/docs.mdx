## Usage

```handlebars
<Pds::Modal as |M|>
  <M.Body>...</M.Body>
  <M.Footer>...</M.Footer>
</Pds::Modal>
```
<ArgsTable of="PdsModal" />


## Styling
```scss
@use "pds/components/modal";
```


## Markup
The `<Pds::Modal>` Ember component and its subcomponents handle generation of
semantic markup.


## Accessibility
- `Esc` may be pressed to call the `@onClose` action (only when focus is
  _within_ the Modal root element).
- While one or more modals are open, `<main>` page content as well as
  other siblings of the ModalArea container should be inert.
- Modals should open in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner.
  - The most recent modal should be active with contextual focus
    (all other modals should be inert).
  - When a modal closes, the previous modal should become active.
- Keyboard focus should not escape the modal dialog.
