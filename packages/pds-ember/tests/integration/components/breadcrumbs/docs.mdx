# Breadcrumbs
Breadcrumbs help the user navigate back to pages that are above the current page
in the IA hierarchy.

## Usage
The `<Pds::Breadcrumbs>` component yields a hash with which provides a `Crumb`
and `Divider` subcomponent for use to compose your markup.

* The `Crumb` component should be used to wrap any palpable content.
    * plain text and hyperlinks are the most common
* The `Crumb` component should handle most known use cases.
  * The `Divider` component should be reserved for unknown edge cases.

```handlebars
<Pds::Breadcrumbs as |B|>
  <B.Crumb>{{! crumb 1 content }}</B.Crumb>
  {{! ... }}
  <B.Crumb>{{! crumb N content }}</B.Crumb>
</Pds::Breadcrumbs>
```

1. The first crumb should match the top level navigation item and should not
   include things like Namespaces or Organizations.
2. The current page title should only be included as a crumb if it is not
   displayed in the page header.
    * This saves space and avoids duplicate information.

### Shallow Nesting
For shallow nesting (1-4 levels), all crumbs should be visible and navigable.

```handlebars
<Pds::Breadcrumbs as |B|>
  <B.Crumb><a href="#">Level 1</a></B.Crumb>
  <B.Crumb><a href="#">Level 2</a></B.Crumb>
  <B.Crumb><a href="#">Level 3</a></B.Crumb>
  <B.Crumb><a href="#">Level 4</a></B.Crumb>
</Pds::Breadcrumbs>
```


### Deep Nesting
For deep nesting (5+ levels):

* the first level should be visible and navigable
* the last 3 levels should be visible and navigable
* all levels in between should be replaced with a single `...` crumb


For example, let's assume your breadcrumb navigation has 7 levels of crumbs
between the current page and the top-level navigation route.

```handlebars
<Pds::Breadcrumbs as |B|>
  <B.Crumb><a href="#">Level 1</a></B.Crumb>
  <B.Crumb aria-hidden="true">...</B.Crumb>{{! literal '...' }}
  <B.Crumb><a href="#">Level 5</a></B.Crumb>
  <B.Crumb><a href="#">Level 6</a></B.Crumb>
  <B.Crumb><a href="#">Level 7</a></B.Crumb>
</Pds::Breadcrumbs>
```
* level 1 is visible and navigable
* levels 5-7 are visible and navigable
* levels 2-4 are replaced by a `...` crumb



### With Icon
Use the icon variant when inside of a folder structure or to provide clarity
about the types of pages in the path.

```handlebars
<Pds::Breadcrumbs as |B|>
  <Pds::Icon @type="folder-outline" />
  <B.Crumb>{{! crumb 1 }}</B.Crumb>
  {{! ... }}
  <B.Crumb>{{! crumb N }}</B.Crumb>
</Pds::Breadcrumbs>
```


## Styling
```scss
@use "pds/components/breadcrumbs";
```


## Markup
The `<Pds::Breadcrumbs>` component handles generation of semantic HTML markup.


## Accessibility
The `<Pds::Breadcrumbs>` component renders a semantic `<nav>` element.

1. Any child element/component that does NOT contain a hyperlink should have the
   `aria-hidden="true"` attribute applied, in order to prevent screen readers
   from trying to announce non-navigational content.
    * See [Deep Nesting](#deep-nesting) for an example.
    * The `<Pds::Icon>` component does this automatically.
